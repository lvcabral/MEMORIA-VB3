# MEMORIA-VB3
Memory Puzzle Game implemented in Visual Basic 3

## Project History
This game was originally developed in 1992 using Visual Basic 1, at the time I was a programmer for the Brazilian Army, developing in COBOL for a text based mini-computer, but I wanted to learn how to program for Windows 3, so I purchased the first Visual Basic book published in Brazil and decided to create a couple of puzzle games, basically to learn how to implement new cool Windows features such as "drag-and-drop", a very advanced concept for the time!

This game was the second one I developed, the first one was Peg Solitaire, check it at: [RESTA1-VB3](https://github.com/lvcabral/RESTA1-VB3)

This repository has the source code for Visual Basic 3 (I converted as soon as I got my hands on the VB3 disks) but has no changes, is the same version I programmed in VB1.
